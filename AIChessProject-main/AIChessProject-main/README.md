# AIChessProject
Ai Chess project in Python using mainly minmax and alpha beta pruning
Built chess GUI using pygame
Used different algorithms to build the ai, and test which algorithm would be more efficient.
Implemented minmax, greedy algorithm, Nega max, and alpha beta pruning using different cutoffs to control the ai's difficulty/ intelligence.

Might work on more features and fix some bugs in the future.
